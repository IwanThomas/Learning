Some tips when it comes to effective communication:
- Begin a call with “The Purpose of this call” or something of the like
- Assume people know nothing. Assume they are bored, tired and have forgotten why they have come. Bring everybody up to speed and give context. Start from nothing - if they happen to know more than that, you can skip over things quickly.
- Nobody wants to read a slide - use as few words as possible, and pictures where you can.
- Make font very big!
- Title of a slide should have the main point of slide. Instead of calling a slide "Methodology", instead call it "We build a logistic regression model".
- When making a case, your audience should convince themselves such that when you come to your conclusion they are already in agreement with you.
- Use pictorial representations where possible.
- Use layman’s terms as much as possible.

Work towards an ability to interpret and summarize results broadly for technical and non-technical audiences
